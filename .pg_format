# PostgreSQL-official style (i.e., keywords uppercase, aligned clauses, moderate indentation) you might set:
# keyword-case = 2
# type-case = 2
# function-case = 0 (or maybe 2 if you want functions uppercase)
# spaces = 2 or 4 depending on your preference.
# tabs = 0 (i.e., use spaces).
# wrap-limit = 80 (to keep line width moderate).
# wrap-after = 4 or so (to break long lists).
# no-extra-line = 1 if you prefer less blank lines between statements.
#
# Compact developer-friendly variant (less vertical whitespace, smaller indentation, minimal breaks):
# spaces = 2
# tabs = 0
# wrap-limit = 120 or even 0 (disable wrapping)
# comma-break = 0
# no-extra-line = 1
# 
# Possibly function-case = 1 (lowercase) and keyword-case = 1 (lowercase) if you like that style.
# Because you’re working on system documentation for the SEAD infrastructure, you may want to define a team-wide standard config file (e.g., .pg_format) and commit it in your GitHub repository. That way, folks formatting SQL scripts (imports, API queries, change‐scripts) all use the same conventions, and your documentation (e.g., “SQL style guide” section) can reference “use this .pg_format config”.
# You can include the above config file in your infrastructure docs (in the “Code Style / Formatting” section) so that new team members know the standard immediately.
