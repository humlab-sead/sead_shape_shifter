# Tiny DSL Expression Support in extra_columns

The "extra_colums" key in an entity's specification provides a way of adding new columns to the resulting DataFrame. The extra_columns value is a dict, where each key is the name of the new column, and the value is the initial value of the new column. The value can be a constant, or anoother column in the source or DataFrame.

It would be useful to support simple expressions in the key's value, e.g. create a fullname column for two first/last name columns. The expressions could translate to Pandas operations, or a python function that transforms the Pandas DataFrame.

Please suggest a YAML-notation for the expression in the extra-columns section for this feature, and how it could be implemented.. Try to make this feature simple but useful.


## Feature Idea

Add expressions under extra_columns using a tiny DSL in YAML, e.g.
```yml
extra_columns:
  fullname: "{row.first_name} + ' ' + {row.last_name}"
  initials: "concat(initials, first_name[:1], last_name[:1])"
```
where {row.X} refers to source/df fields and helpers (like concat or slicing) map to Pandas-friendly Python.

## Implementation path:
 - Interpret the string by formatting it inside a sandboxed helper that injects the current pandas.Series (row) or even the whole DataFrame.
 - For column-wise expressions, leverage df.eval/df.assign after prepping a safe namespace with allowed functions (concat, upper, etc.).
 - For more complex transformations, allow users to specify "lambda df: df['a'] + df['b']" (evaluated via eval with a restricted globals containing only helpers and pd).
- Keep simple by defaulting to expressions evaluated per-row via df.eval or df.assign, with ability to refer to any existing column.

## Next steps:

1. Decide whether expressions should be evaluated row-by-row (via df.assign(extra=...)) or on the whole DataFrame.
2. Implement parsing/evaluation in the pipeline step where extra_columns currently get applied (likely near the Filter/Link stage).
3. Add tests covering constant, direct column reference, and expression cases.
Expression Detection

Treat every extra_columns value as a string; interpret it as an expression only if it uses a special marker (e.g., starts with expr: or contains {/} tokens). Anything else stays literal.
Recommended rule: if the string matches expr:<python> (e.g., fullname: "expr:df['first_name'] + ' ' + df['last_name']"), run it through the expression evaluator; otherwise just assign the string directly.
This keeps defaults simple (constants work out of the box) while giving a clear hint when evaluation is intended.

Using "expr: python-pandas-row-expression" sounds great. It might be a bit complicated for non-technical users, thoght. Can you suggest a layer/notation above these expressions that exposes the most common e.g. string expressions,a nd that "ompiles" into these pandas expressions? E.g. "= <user-friendly-expression>" by the backend compiles to "expr:<corresponding-python-expression>". In such a case, non-tech user can add simple expressions, but we still have a super-user option.


Expression DSL

Introduce a mini DSL for extra_columns like:

extra_columns:
  fullname: "=concat(first_name, ' ', last_name)"
  initials: "=upper(substr(first_name, 0, 1)) + upper(substr(last_name, 0, 1))"
  source_note: "expr:df['city'] + ' (' + df['code'] + ')'"
Strings starting with = are treated as friendly expressions; strings starting with expr: are raw pandas expressions for power users. Anything else stays constant.

Backend implementation: parse the string when it’s added to the DataFrame. If the value starts with expr:, strip the prefix and run it through df.assign(**{name: eval(expr, safe_globals, {"df": df})}). If it starts with =, feed it to a small compiler that replaces helper names with pandas operations (e.g., concat(a, b) → df['a'].astype(str) + df['b'].astype(str), upper(x) → df['x'].str.upper(), substr(x, start, length) → df['x'].str[start:start+length], ifnull(x, default) etc.), then evaluate the resulting pandas expression in the same safe context. Constants remain untouched.

Keep helper mappings simple so non-technical users can combine columns with string functions; expose more via extending the compiler (e.g., additional helpers for dates or math).
